This assignment is to be done individually. You cannot use code written by your classmates. Use code found over the Internet at your own peril -- it may not do exactly what the assignment requests. If you do end up using code you find on the Internet, you must disclose the origin of the code. Concealing the origin of a piece of code is plagiarism. Use EdDiscussion for general questions whose answers can benefit you and everyone, but remember that EdDiscussion is considered a student-student discussion forum in this course. If necessary, ask for clarifications directly from the teaching team during lecture and discussion sessions.
